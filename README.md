# Escape the Factory

This project is a Greenfoot game where your goal is to escape the factory before time runs out.

## Opening the project in Greenfoot

1. Open Greenfoot.
2. Press `Command + O` to open a project.
3. Select the `Escape the Factory` folder in this repository (the folder that contains `project.greenfoot`).

## Game objective

- Escape the factory in **85 seconds or less**.
- Collect **3 total keys** to unlock the outside exit door.
- Keys are found in chests across different factory rooms.

If you run out of time, you lose.

## Controls

- Move with `W`, `A`, `S`, `D`.
- Press `I` to interact with objects (like chests and movable blocks).
- In the main room, walk through doors to move between rooms.

## Room-specific notes

- **Dodging Blocks Room:** Hitting a block removes a random amount of remaining time.
- **Moving Blocks Room:** Use `I` to grab and move blocks so you can reach the chest and door.
- **Maze Room:** The maze switches between two maps, and chest/door locations change.

## HUD

The top-left corner shows:

- Keys collected
- Time remaining (seconds)
